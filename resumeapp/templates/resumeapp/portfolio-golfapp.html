      </div>
      <p class="card-text">The starting point, once I had decided to build something using Python, was to sketch out some requirements to help guide the build. This required answering two main questions:</p>
      <hr>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>What Statistics to Track?</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>Brainstormed potential statistics to collect, from basic to more advanced. Decided to design something to capture a little more than basic as this would provide some more opportunities to use different techniques.</li>
              <li>Created mock stats in Excel to refine the data structure. This helped confirm the types of scenarios to be handled, such as where some stats would not be applicable and where handling of null values was going to be required.</li>
              <li>Researched UI designs for inspiration, adopting ideas for navigation and button-based inputs into my design.</li>
                  
              
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>How to Make App Accessible on Any Device?</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>Being new to the concept of python applications, I consulted ChatGPT for mobile app development advice. It was recommended that building a web-based application using either Flask or Django was the best option for someone new to the area.</li>
              <li>Decided to build towards a web-based app, which led to a few other considerations that I dealt with on my app building journey, including:
                <ul>
                  <li>How to manage the data that my app would be collecting</li>
                  <li>How to host a web applicaton</li>
                  <li>How to manage version control of my app</li>

        <h3 class="card-title">Development</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="card-text">With some idea of what I wanted to build the next thing was to get into actually building something. I initially used Flask to build a working prototype of my app, although it was missing a lot of things. After researching Django a bit more I decided to transition to use it as the web framework for my app.</p>
      <hr>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>Initial Prototype in Flask</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>Built an initial version using Flask that allowed me to get the fundamentals of the app created and running on my localhost.</li>
              <li>Created functionality to allow a user to go through 18 holes and enter data by clicking buttons, as opposed to selecting from dropdown options, and being able to navigate back and forth to previously entered data.</li>
              <li>Gained a better understanding of how Python can be used in a practical application.</li>
              <li>Gained experience in HTML, CSS and Javascript through getting this version to work locally.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>Improved Version on Django</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>After a steep learning curve in Flask I decided to look into using Django, which turned out to be a steeper learning curve!</li>
              <li>After taking some time to learn Django, I benefitted from the built-in user authentication, simple data table creation, and code reusability of Django.</li>
              <li>My previous experience with data structures and SQL came in handy as Django keeps this stuff in the background, but you still need to know how relational tables work to make sure any foreign keys are set up correctly!</li>

      <p class="card-text">When I started out my focus was on Python and getting a practical project under my belt. Little did I know how far into web-development I would end up going (not that far for anyone who actually does this stuff, but a lot farther than I was expecting). So all my work on the app required me to get my head around this stuff so I could deploy my app and actually use it.</p>

              <li>Used some other practice projects and loaded them onto the site to get used to the process and find out the little tips and tricks for getting all the settings to line up.</li>

                      <li>The course played, which in my case will normally be Shandon!! I can manually update the app with details for as many courses as I like.</li>

                  <li>There is also a cancel button to allow a user to navigate back to the home screen for the app.</li>
                  <li>This page is based on a Django Form, which takes care of most of the heavy lifting and Bootstrap provides the formatting. The most technical aspect is the script to return the list of tees based on the selected course.</li>

                    <li><strong>Hole Details (number and par)</strong> - These are provided based on the course being played.</li>
                    <li><strong>Score</strong> - This is set to the par of the hole to begin with and buttons are used to increase or decrease the score.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clickable Buttons</strong> (Fairwar, Green, Putts, Up/Down, Sand Save, and Penalties) - These all allow one option to be selected, and deselected if necessary. Colour coding of the buttons indicate if the chosen option is good or not.</li>
                    <li><strong>Numeric Options</strong> (Drive and First Putt Distance) - Values are manually entered with upper and lower limits for what can be entered.</li>
                    <li><strong>Next / Back Navigation</strong> - These are used to move from one hole to another. Moving backwards will repopulate the previously entered data, where available. At the end of the round the 'Next' button turns into 'Complete' to finish the round and move to a summary page.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fairway Values Removed on Par Threes</strong> - The two fairway related stats are not applicable for par threes so these get hidden when on a par three.</li>

<!-- Overview of the Golf Stats App

Situation: When I embarked on my Python journey, I wanted to create something useful and enjoyable. As an avid golfer, I envisioned a mobile-friendly golf statistics app. The challenge: how to bring this idea to life?

Task: I had to clarify two main objectives:

Determine the specific statistics to track.

Ensure mobile accessibility for the app.

Action:

Stats to Collect:

I brainstormed potential statistics, from basic (fairways, greens, putts) to advanced (shot-level data, GPS tracking).

Settled on a balance between simplicity and detail.

Created mock stats in Excel to refine data structure.

Researched UI designs for inspiration, adopting intuitive navigation and button-based inputs.

Accessibility:

Consulted ChatGPT for mobile app development advice, leading to a choice between Flask and Django web frameworks.

Built an initial version using Flask, gaining experience in HTML and CSS.

Explored hosting options, selecting PythonAnywhere for its beginner-friendly environment.

Transitioned from Flask to Django after further research, benefiting from user authentication, data table creation, and code reusability.

Expanded the app to serve as my personal website, incorporating JavaScript for functionality and Bootstrap for styling.

Utilized GitHub for version control, learning Git fundamentals to manage the project effectively.

Result: The final product is a mobile-accessible golf stats app that I can use at the course. It includes a guest login for broader access.

Future Developments: Plans include enhancing the app’s analytical capabilities and trend analysis as more data is collected.

Skills Used:

Python: Backend development, data manipulation.

Django: Web framework, user authentication, data models.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Frontend development, responsive design.

Bootstrap: Styling and layout.

GitHub: Version control, project management. -->
