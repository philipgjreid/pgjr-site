      <p class="card-text">While I was working at the Ministry of Justice (circa 2024) as a risk consultant, I developed a proof-of-concept app using Power Apps for risk and assurance management. The existing risk tool had been created to move from using Excel based risk registers, but still had several limitations and missing functionality. My aim was to show what could be done using Power Apps as a potential future tooling option.</p>

            <li><strong>Current State Assessment</strong> - Assessed the current state and documented future state requirements as a baseline for creating the PoC app
            </li>
            <li><strong>Developed PoC Risk Tool</strong> Developed an app to showcase the potential functionality that could be built using Power Apps
            </li>
            <li><strong>Business Case for Risk Tool</strong> - Presented the PoC app to my team and incorporated the option into a draft business case

      <p class="card-text">The existing solutions had previously moved from using Excel based risk registers to creating a risk tool in Oracle Application Express. While this tool provided a better central repository for managing risks, the solution had several major limitations was relatively simple with a single record for each risk. It tracked risk controls and risk treatments using free-text fields for each risk, which was one of the main drivers to consider a new solution. The main requirements were to create a Control Library and a Treatment Register so those activities could be tracked and linked to multiple risks, where required. An uplift in assurance processes also necessitated the tracking  of control assessments, which was going to have to be done using Excel spreadsheets.</p>

          <h4>What to Include</h4>
          <ul> <!--obvious stuff like resume and portfolio of things i have done. Looked for inspiration but largely followed my instinct. -->
              <li>The inspiration for creating my own site was to be able to represent myself in more detail than what a CV can. This meant that I wanted to start with:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>CV / Resume</strong> - To begin with I decided to recreate my CV in a digital format.</li>
                  <li><strong>Portfolio</strong> - Creating a portfolio to exhibit things I have done, either personally or professionally. This obviously included the golf app as well as other projects I have completed and things I continue to work on.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>              
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>How to Format the Site</h4>
          <ul> <!--this is both the overall layout and all the cosmetic things. Mention options of getting free html or building things and that i did a bit of both to learn more. -->
              <li><strong>Site Structure</strong> - The overall structure and layout was my first consideration. This largely flowed from the simple content that I was aiming to create. The Resume and Portfolio, plus a Home page...and the golf app of course.</li>
              <li><strong>Content Formatting</strong> - The formatting was the more complicated aspect. To manage things like colour schemes, fonts, and general layout using techniques based in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap required a lot of trial and error.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3 class="card-title">Developed Content</h3>
      </div> <!--talk through how each aspect of the site was developed or more generally. resume, portfolio pages, navbar, formatting. -->
      <p class="card-text">With an idea of what I wanted to create I got into making it. Here is an overview of the key things I completed.</p>
      <hr> <!--to cover things like building the resume page and refining to have my own sidebar, creating a portfolio structure that i can extend in future. -->
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h4>Resume Page</h4>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Resume Project</strong> - One of the projects I completed to learn how to use Django was to create a resume site. This used a free HTML template with a lot of really good built-in functionality. I used this as my initial resume page and incorporated it into my overall project.</li>
              <li><strong>Customisation</strong> - The resume template was good, but it came with its own styling and functionality. I customised it to use the styling from my project for consistency. I also replaced the template navbar as I already had a navbar in my overall site.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <h4>Portfolio Page and Sub-page Structure</h4>
          <ul> <!--to cover off creating the landing page for the portfolio and building templates to use for each of the projects to be added over time. -->
              <li>The portfolio section needed a landing page and then a way to manage projects and examples as I add to the portfolio.</li>
              <li><strong>Portfolio Landing Page</strong> - When I thought about the types of things I wanted to include in my portfolio, I decided that it fell into either personal projects (like the golf app) or examples from my career. This dictated splitting the landing page into two parts. I did this by:
                <ul>
                  <li>Splitting the page into two sections using a heading that spans the whole page.</li>
                  <li>Using Bootstrap cards and other formatting features to store each of the projects or subjects to make it easy for the content to resize with the window size.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Portfolio Pages</strong> - Each project or example gets its own page. I have tried to keep the structures of the page fairly simple so they can be reused for multiple subjects without too much readjusting.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Similar Bootstrap formatting was used to manage the content in sections that can resize with the size of the screen.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h4>Home Page</h4>
          <ul> <!--to cover the selection of a theme for this page that i then used across the site. -->
              <li>The concept of a home page got me looking around at overall themes for the site. I came across one that was fairly simple and suited the type of content I was trying to create. I incorporated this into my page by:
                <ul>
                  <li>Copying the example page HTML and CSS into my page.</li>
                  <li>Working out the aspects of the example code that I wanted to keep in terms of functionality and theme.</li>
                  <li>Created my own version of a home page using the techniques I found useful.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <h4>General Techniques Used</h4>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Pre-made Layouts</strong> - A helpful tip I got was to use HTML templates to help shortcut creating pages. There was a learning curve for how to use a mix of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap layout and formatting approaches and getting them to work together. While I did copy HTML / CSS from various places to some extent, I tried to manually adjust a lot of it to help learn how things work.</li>
              <!-- <li><strong>Theme</strong> - Getting the colours and overall consistency of the site working required finding where settings were coming from. As this was my first website attempt, it definitely has room for improvement, but this allowed me to learn more as I went.</li> -->
              <li><strong>AI Support</strong> - I leaned heavily on the likes of Copilot and ChatGPT throughout the entire process to find out how to do things, trouble shoot code, and generally work on the components to be able to build the overall site.</li>
              <li><strong>Online Resources</strong> - I spent a lot of time watching instructional videos to learn the fundamentals of things like Django and GitHub and also to help with more specific techniques and approaches.</li>
          </ul>

              <li>Used some other practice projects and loaded them onto the site to get used to the process and find out the little tips and tricks for getting all the settings to line up.</li>
