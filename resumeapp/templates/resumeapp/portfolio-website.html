      <p class="card-text">I built a golf stats app to help learn more about Python. Along the way this turned into a web-based app and I decided to extend that project into building myself a personal website.....this website!! Most of what I did is covered in my summary for my golf stats app project 
        (<span><a href="{% url 'portfolio-golfapp' %}">check it out here</a></span>), but here is a view of what building the website involved.</p>

        <h3 class="card-title">Extended Site</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="card-text">The golf app had already allowed me to create a Django project with several pages providing the basis to create more pages using similar techniques. The personal website was slightly easier to build due to being mainly static pages. I still needed to work out a few things:</p>
      <hr>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>What to Include</h4>
          <ul> <!--obvious stuff like resume and portfolio of things i have done. Looked for inspiration but largely followed my instinct. -->
              <li>The inspiration for creating my own site was to be able to represent myself in more detail than what a CV can. This meant that I wanted to start with:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>CV / Resume</strong> - To begin with I decided to recreate my CV in a digital format.</li>
                  <li><strong>Portfolio</strong> - Creating a portfolio to exhibit things I have done, either personally or professionally, was the content that I was really interested in building and sharing. This obviously included the golf app as well as other things I have done and things I continue to work on.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>              
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>How to Format the Site</h4>
          <ul> <!--this is both the overall layout and all the cosmetic things. Mention options of getting free html or building things and that i did a bit of both to learn more. -->
              <li><strong>Site Structure</strong> - The overall structure and layout was my first consideration. This largely flowed from the simple content that I was aiming to create. The Resume and Portfolio, plus a Home page...and the golf app of course.</li>
              <li><strong>Content Formatting</strong> - The formatting was the more complicated aspect. To manage things like colour schemes, fonts, and general layout using techniques based in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap required a lot of trial and error.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="card-title">Developed Content</h3>
      </div> <!--talk through how each aspect of the site was developed or more generally. resume, portfolio pages, navbar, formatting. -->
      <p class="card-text">With an idea of what I wanted to create I got into making it. Here is an overview of the key things I did.</p>
      <hr> <!--to cover things like building the resume page and refining to have my own sidebar, creating a portfolio structure that i can extend in future. -->
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h4>Resume Page</h4>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Resume Project</strong> - One of the projects I did to learn how to use Django was to create a resume site. This used a free HTML template with a lot of really good built-in functionality. I used this as my initial resume page and incorporated it into my overall project.</li>
              <li><strong>Navbar Issues</strong> - While the resume template was good, it ran into problems as it had a navbar and so did my overall site. These did not play nicely together. To fix this I replaced the navbar with a sidebar that achieved a similar level of navigating functionality but also allowed my site navbar to display on the page.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <h4>Portfolio Page and Sub-page Structure</h4>
          <ul> <!--to cover off creating the landing page for the portfolio and building templates to use for each of the projects to be added over time. -->
              <li>The portfolio section needed a landing page and then a way to manage projects and examples as I add to the portfolio.</li>
              <li><strong>Portfolio Landing Page</strong> - When I thought about the types of things I wanted to include in my portfolio, I decided that it fell into either personal projects (like the golf app) or examples from my career. This dictated splitting the landing page into two parts. I did this by:
                <ul>
                  <li>Splitting the page into two sections using a heading that spans the whole page.</li>
                  <li>Using Bootstrap cards and other formatting features to store each of the projects or subjects to make it easy for the content to resize with the window size.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Portfolio Pages</strong> - Each project or example gets its own page. I have tried to keep the structures of the page fairly simple so they can be reused for multiple subjects without too much readjusting.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Similar Bootstrap formatting was used to manage the content in sections that can resize with the size of the screen.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h4>Home Page</h4>
          <ul> <!--to cover the selection of a theme for this page that i then used across the site. -->
              <li>The concept of a home page got me looking around at overall themes for the site. I came across one that was fairly simple and suited the type of content I was trying to create. I incorporated this into my page by:
                <ul>
                  <li>Copying the example page HTML and CSS into my page.</li>
                  <li>Working out the aspects of the example code that I wanted to keep in terms of functionality and theme.</li>
                  <li>Created my own version of a home page using the techniques I found useful.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <h4>General Techniques Used</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>Layout - There was a learning curve for how to use a mix of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap layout and formatting approaches and getting them to work together. Using HTML templates was a key tip to help shortcut creating the overall page, but I somewhat went against this. I did use other HTML, but I tried to manually adjust a lot of it to help learn how things work.</li>
              <li>Theme - Getting the colours and overall consistency of the site working required finding where settings were coming from. As this was my first website attempt, it definitely has room for improvement, but this allowed me to learn more as I went.</li>
              <li>AI Support - I leaned heavily on the likes of co-pilot and ChatGPT throughout the entire process to find out how to do things, trouble shoot code, and generally work on the components to be able to build the overall site.</li>
              <li>Online Resources - I spent a lot of time watching instructional videos to both learn fundamentals and also to work on more specific techniques.</li>
          </ul>

      </div>
      <p class="card-text">Before I deployed my page and started telling people about it, I needed to make sure that the content was at a level I was happy with and that I was going to be able to get the page hosted and support it into the future. The content was a matter of iterating and getting feedback, mostly from my wife! The ability to get the page out there came down to hosting and version control.</p>

          <h4>Hosting Options</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>Explored hosting options, selecting PythonAnywhere for its beginner-friendly environment (and the free-tier option in case everything went sideways on me).</li>
              <li>Used some other practice projects and loaded them onto the site to get used to the process and find out the little tips and tricks for getting all the settings to line up.</li>

              <li>Have gained experience across the range of tools and techniques required to get a webpage published.</li>
